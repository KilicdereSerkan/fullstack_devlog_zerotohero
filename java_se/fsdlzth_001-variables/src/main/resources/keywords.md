# KEYWORDS
### A keyword is any one of a number of reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the Java language.
### These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (names) for variables, methods, classes, or other user-defined elements.
### There are two types of keywords in Java: reserved keywords and contextual keywords.
### Reserved keywords have a fixed meaning in the language and cannot be used for any other purpose.
### Contextual keywords, on the other hand, have a special meaning only in certain contexts,and can be used as identifiers in other contexts.
### keywords need to be in lowercase letters.
